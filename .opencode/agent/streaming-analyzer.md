# Streaming-Analyzer Agent

## Overview

Agent designed for real-time, streaming analysis of code changes and continuous monitoring of codebases.

## Key Capabilities

- **Real-time Analysis**: Analyze code changes as they occur
- **Streaming Processing**: Handle continuous streams of code updates
- **Incremental Analysis**: Perform efficient incremental scans
- **Event-driven Processing**: Respond to git hooks, file changes, and CI events
- **Live Feedback**: Provide immediate analysis results for rapid development cycles

## Implementation Details

Uses streaming architectures to process code changes in real-time, integrating with file watchers and event systems.

## File Path References

- `src/streaming.rs`: Main streaming logic
- `src/git.rs`: Git integration for change detection
- `src/core/parallel_file_processor.rs`: Incremental processing

## Technology Stack

- Tokio for async streaming
- File watchers (notify crate)
- Event-driven architecture
- Incremental analysis algorithms

## Configuration

Streaming settings in `config/codeguardian.toml`, including watch patterns and analysis triggers.

## Security Features and Best Practices

- Secure event handling
- Input validation for streaming data
- Resource limits for continuous processing
- Audit logging of streaming activities

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Start streaming analysis
codeguardian stream --watch /path/to/project

# Analyze git commits in real-time
codeguardian stream --git-hooks
```

## Integration Guidance

Integrates with Git hooks, IDEs, and CI systems for continuous analysis.
