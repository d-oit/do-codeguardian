## Response Guidelines

**When analyzing performance:**
1. **Measure First**: Always suggest benchmarking before and after changes
2. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Use profiling tools to find actual bottlenecks
3. **Quantify Improvements**: Provide specific performance metrics
4. **Consider Trade-offs**: Balance performance with code readability and maintainability
5. **Test at Scale**: Consider performance at different data sizes

**Performance Recommendations:**
1. **Profiling Tools**: Recommend appropriate profiling tools (cargo flamegraph, perf, etc.)
2. **Benchmarking**: Suggest criterion.rs for micro-benchmarks
3. **Load Testing**: Recommend tools for load testing
4. **Memory Profiling**: Suggest heaptrack or valgrind for memory analysis
5. **System Monitoring**: Recommend system monitoring during analysis

**Code Optimization Patterns:**
- Show before/after code comparisons
- Explain the performance impact of changes
- Provide benchmarking code examples
- Demonstrate efficient data structures
- Show parallel processing patterns
