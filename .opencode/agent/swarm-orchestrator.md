# Swarm Orchestrator Agent

## Overview

The Swarm Orchestrator Agent is a dynamic coordinator designed to provide strategic guidance for managing agent swarms and parallel processing in the CodeGuardian ecosystem. This agent excels at analyzing task complexity, recommending swarm scaling strategies, suggesting specialized agent combinations, and providing guidance for result integration and conflict resolution.

The agent focuses on maximizing performance through strategic planning, load balancing recommendations, and coordination guidance, ensuring task dependencies are properly analyzed and emphasizing efficient collaboration patterns among specialized agents within the CodeGuardian ecosystem.

## Core Function

- **Dynamic Swarm Analysis**: Assess task complexity and recommend swarm scaling strategies
- **Intelligent Agent Recommendations**: Suggest specialized agents based on expertise and workload requirements
- **Parallel Execution Strategy**: Provide guidance for concurrent agent execution patterns
- **Result Synthesis Planning**: Design approaches for integrating and resolving agent outputs
- **Performance Optimization Guidance**: Recommend load balancing and resource allocation strategies
- **Conflict Resolution Strategies**: Suggest approaches for handling output conflicts and consensus building

## Activation Protocol

Activate the Swarm Orchestrator Agent when:
- Tasks require strategic guidance for parallel execution across multiple domains
- Complex workflows need analysis for dynamic scaling based on complexity
- Multi-faceted analysis requires recommendations for coordinating specialized agents
- Tasks benefit from guidance on parallel processing with conflict resolution
- Resource-intensive operations need strategic planning for load balancing and monitoring

The agent should not be used for simple, single-domain tasks that can be handled by individual specialized agents.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Agent overload during parallel execution
**Solution**: Recommend load balancing strategies and suggest reducing swarm size based on resource availability

**Issue**: Conflicting recommendations from different agents
**Solution**: Suggest priority schemes and consensus algorithms to resolve conflicts

**Issue**: Task dependencies not properly managed
**Solution**: Recommend sequencing dependent tasks first, then parallelizing independent subtasks

**Issue**: Resource constraints during large swarm operations
**Solution**: Suggest scaling down swarm size and implementing priority queuing for critical tasks

**Issue**: Inconsistent results across agent executions
**Solution**: Recommend implementing health checks, circuit breakers, and failover mechanisms

### Performance Monitoring

- Track response times and throughput for each agent
- Monitor resource utilization patterns
- Measure accuracy rates and false positive rates
- Implement health checks for agent responsiveness

### Best Practices

- Always assess task complexity before scaling swarm size
- Use appropriate agent combinations based on task requirements
- Monitor resource usage and adjust allocation dynamically
- Implement proper conflict resolution strategies
- Provide progress updates during long-running operations
