## Agent Configuration

All agents are configured in the main `opencode.json` file with the following settings:

- **Mode**: All agents are configured as `subagent` mode for specialized tasks
- **Temperature**: Set appropriately for each agent's task (0.1-0.3 range)
- **Tools**: Configured with read-only access for analysis, selective write/bash access
- **No Model Configuration**: Model selection is handled at runtime by the OpenCode system

## Usage

### Invoking Agents

You can invoke these agents in several ways:

1. **Direct Invocation**: Mention the agent by name in your request
   ```
   @security-auditor please review this code for security vulnerabilities
   ```

2. **Task Delegation**: Use the Task tool to launch specific agents
   ```
   Use the Task tool to launch the performance-optimizer agent to analyze this function
   ```

3. **Automatic Activation**: Agents can be automatically triggered based on context and content

### Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Clearly describe what you want the agent to analyze or optimize
- **Provide Context**: Include relevant code, configuration, or requirements
- **Set Expectations**: Specify the scope and depth of analysis needed
- **Follow Recommendations**: Implement agent suggestions incrementally and test thoroughly

### Swarm Orchestration

The **Swarm Orchestrator Agent** is the dedicated agent for coordinating multiple specialized agents in parallel for complex tasks:

- **When to Use**: Complex analysis requiring multiple perspectives (security + performance + quality)
- **Benefits**: Parallel execution, comprehensive coverage, unified synthesis of results
- **Available Agents**: All 8 specialized agents can be orchestrated together
- **Coordination**: Handles conflicts and synthesizes findings into unified reports

**Example Usage:**
```
@swarm-orchestrator perform a comprehensive security and performance review of the new authentication module
```
This will automatically coordinate the security-auditor, performance-optimizer, and code-quality-reviewer agents in parallel.

**Advanced Usage:**
```
@swarm-orchestrator swarm-optimize and secure the entire ML pipeline
```
This will dynamically scale and coordinate relevant agents based on task complexity.

## Enhanced CI/CD Workflow

## Customization

To customize agent behavior:

1. **Modify Agent Files**: Edit the `.md` files in this directory to adjust agent prompts and behavior
2. **Update Configuration**: Modify `opencode.json` to change model, temperature, or tool access
3. **Add New Agents**: Create new `.md` files following the established format

### Enterprise Support Configuration

By default, agents are configured to focus on community and open-source usage. To control enterprise support output:

- Set `"enterprise_support": false` in `opencode.json` to disable default enterprise support messaging
- Set `"enterprise_support": true` to enable enterprise-focused responses when needed
- Individual agents can be configured with custom enterprise support behavior in their `.md` files
