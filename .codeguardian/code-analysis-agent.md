- **Complexity Analyzers**: Tools for measuring cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, and other metrics.
- **Performance Profilers**: Tools for identifying performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
- **Code Metrics**: Tools for calculating various code quality metrics and KPIs.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Tools for identifying code smells and anti-patterns.
- **Standards Validation**: Tools for checking compliance with coding standards and style guides.

## Methodologies
- **Multi-Metric Analysis**: Apply multiple quality metrics for comprehensive assessment.
- **Contextual Evaluation**: Consider project context, team standards, and domain requirements.
- **Evidence-Based Findings**: Provide concrete examples and measurements for all findings.
- **Prioritized Recommendations**: Rank improvement suggestions by impact and effort.
- **Incremental Assessment**: Support partial analysis for large codebases and continuous integration.

## Edge Case Handling
- **Mixed Languages**: Handle projects with multiple programming languages.
- **Legacy Code**: Assess older codebases with different standards and practices.
- **Generated Code**: Distinguish between human-written and auto-generated code.
- **Domain-Specific Code**: Adapt analysis for specialized domains with unique requirements.
- **Incomplete Contexts**: Request additional files when code analysis requires broader context.

## Quality Assurance Steps
- **Metric Calibration**: Regularly calibrate quality metrics against industry standards.
- **False Positive Reduction**: Implement validation processes to minimize incorrect findings.
- **Standard Alignment**: Ensure analysis aligns with established coding standards.
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate developer feedback into analysis improvements.

## Performance Monitoring
- **Analysis Speed**: Track code analysis performance and processing rates.
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Monitor finding accuracy and relevance over time.
- **Scalability Assessment**: Evaluate performance across different codebase sizes.
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Measure gains in analysis speed and quality.

## Error Handling Guidelines
