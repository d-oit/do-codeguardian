# 🧪 GitHub Actions Workflow Testing Plan

## 🎯 Test Execution Status

**Test Branch:** `test/workflow-validation`
**Target Branch:** `main`
**Test Commit:** `56e60b4`

### 📋 Pre-Test Checklist
- ✅ All 7 workflows pass YAML validation
- ✅ Syntax errors resolved (110+ → 0)
- ✅ Test branch created with security test files
- ✅ Test files contain intentional security issues
- ✅ Branch pushed to origin

### 🚀 Test Execution Steps

#### Step 1: Create Pull Request
```bash
# Create PR from test/workflow-validation to main
# This should trigger:
# - codeguardian-ci.yml (PR analysis)
# - turbo-pr-analysis.yml (changed files analysis)
```

#### Step 2: Monitor Workflow Execution
**Expected Workflows to Trigger:**
1. **`codeguardian-ci.yml`** - Job: `codeguardian-pr`
2. **`turbo-pr-analysis.yml`** - Job: `quick-turbo-scan`

**Monitor at:** `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions`

### 🔍 Expected Test Results

#### Security Findings Expected:
- 🔴 **Hardcoded API Key**: `sk-test-1234567890abcdef`
- 🟡 **TODO Comments**: "Move to environment variable"
- 🟡 **FIXME Comments**: "Remove debug output"
- 🟠 **SQL Injection Pattern**: Dynamic query construction
- 🟡 **Debug Code**: Conditional debug prints
- 🟠 **Performance Issues**: Nested loops O(n²)

#### Workflow Behavior Expected:
- ✅ **Parse Successfully**: No YAML syntax errors
- ✅ **Execute Steps**: All workflow steps run
- ✅ **Analyze Files**: Process `src/test_security_sample.rs`
- ✅ **Generate Reports**: Create JSON analysis results
- ✅ **Comment on PR**: Post analysis summary
- ✅ **Upload Artifacts**: Store analysis results

### 📊 Success Criteria

#### ✅ Workflow Execution Success:
- [ ] Workflows start without syntax errors
- [ ] All steps execute successfully
- [ ] No YAML parsing failures
- [ ] Proper job completion

#### ✅ Analysis Functionality:
- [ ] Security issues detected in test file
- [ ] Analysis results generated
- [ ] Findings categorized by severity
- [ ] Performance metrics calculated

#### ✅ Integration Features:
- [ ] PR comments posted automatically
- [ ] Artifacts uploaded successfully
- [ ] Proper status checks set
- [ ] No critical workflow failures

### 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

#### If Workflows Don't Trigger:
1. Check PR targets correct branch (`main`)
2. Verify workflow trigger conditions
3. Ensure repository has Actions enabled
4. Check branch protection rules

#### If Workflows Fail:
1. **Syntax Errors**: Should not occur (already fixed)
2. **Runtime Errors**: Expected due to missing CodeGuardian binary
3. **Permission Errors**: Check repository settings
4. **Resource Limits**: Monitor timeout settings

#### Expected Runtime Issues:
- ❌ **CodeGuardian Installation**: Will fail (placeholder URL)
- ❌ **Binary Execution**: CodeGuardian not actually installed
- ✅ **YAML Parsing**: Should succeed completely

### 📈 Test Validation

#### Immediate Validation (Syntax):
- ✅ Workflows appear in Actions tab
- ✅ No "Invalid workflow file" errors
- ✅ Workflow runs start successfully

#### Runtime Validation (Functionality):
- 🔄 Steps execute in sequence
- 🔄 Proper error handling for missing dependencies
- 🔄 Artifact generation attempts
- 🔄 PR interaction features

### 🎉 Success Indicators

**🟢 Complete Success:**
- All workflows parse and start
- Steps execute as expected
- Proper error handling for missing tools
- PR integration features work

**🟡 Partial Success:**
- Workflows parse and start
- Some runtime failures due to missing CodeGuardian
- Core structure and logic validated

**🔴 Failure:**
- Workflows don't appear in Actions
- YAML syntax errors prevent execution
- Complete workflow breakdown
