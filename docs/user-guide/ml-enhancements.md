```toml
[ml.enhancements]
enable_adaptive_learning = true
cache_strategy = "adaptive"
monitoring_interval = 60

[ml.enhancements.adaptive_learning]
feedback_batch_size = 100
adaptation_threshold = 0.05
reliability_tracking = true
active_learning_ratio = 0.1

[ml.enhancements.caching]
max_cache_size_mb = 512
compression_enabled = true
prefetch_enabled = true
eviction_policy = "intelligent_lru"

[ml.enhancements.monitoring]
drift_detection_window = 1000
performance_baseline_window = 5000
auto_tuning_enabled = true
alert_thresholds = { accuracy = 0.05, latency = 0.2 }
```

Command-line options override configuration file settings when specified.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**High Memory Usage**
