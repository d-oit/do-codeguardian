# Validation Reports

This directory contains organized validation reports for different versions of CodeGuardian, providing comprehensive testing and validation data for each release.

## Report Organization Structure

Validation reports are organized hierarchically by version for easy navigation and historical tracking:

```
docs/validation-reports/
├── index.md                           # This overview file
├── v0.2.0-alpha.5/                   # Version-specific directory
│   ├── uat-report.md                 # User Acceptance Testing results
│   └── validation-report.md          # Technical validation results
├── template-uat-report.md            # Template for UAT reports
└── template-validation-report.md     # Template for validation reports
```

## Available Reports

### Current Version: v0.2.0-alpha.5
- **[UAT Report](./v0.2.0-alpha.5/uat-report.md)** - User acceptance testing results and feedback
- **[Validation Report](./v0.2.0-alpha.5/validation-report.md)** - Technical validation, performance metrics, and compliance checks

## How to Find Reports for Specific Versions

### Finding Reports by Version
1. **Navigate by Version Directory**: Each version has its own subdirectory (e.g., `v0.2.0-alpha.5/`)
2. **Check the Index**: This file lists all available versions and their reports
3. **Version Naming Convention**: Reports follow semantic versioning (e.g., `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{prerelease}`)

### Accessing Historical Data
- **Latest Reports**: Always check the highest version number for the most recent validation data
- **Version Comparison**: Compare reports across versions to track improvements and regressions
- **Archive Access**: All historical reports are preserved for compliance and audit purposes

## Report Types

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Reports
- Real-world testing scenarios
- User feedback and usability validation
- Feature verification and acceptance criteria
- Performance benchmarks in production-like environments

### Technical Validation Reports
- Unit and integration test results
- Security validation and vulnerability assessments
- Performance benchmarks and optimization metrics
- Code quality and maintainability analysis
- Compliance and standards verification

## Using Validation Data

### For Development Teams
- Review UAT reports for user impact assessment
- Use validation reports for technical decision making
- Compare performance metrics across versions

### For Quality Assurance
- Access comprehensive test coverage data
- Review security validation results
- Analyze regression testing outcomes

### For Compliance and Audit
- Historical validation data for regulatory requirements
- Version-specific compliance verification
- Audit trails for security assessments

## Contributing to Validation

### Report Templates
- **[UAT Report Template](./template-uat-report.md)** - Standard format for user acceptance testing
- **[Validation Report Template](./template-validation-report.md)** - Standard format for technical validation

### Adding New Reports
1. Create a new version directory (e.g., `v0.2.0-alpha.6/`)
2. Use the provided templates as starting points
3. Follow the established naming conventions
4. Update this index file with the new version information
