- **Multi-Platform Testing**: Validation across different environments
- **Release Automation**: Streamlined build and deployment processes

## üìä Performance Metrics

- **File Processing**: Up to 40% faster for large codebases
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced by 25% through string pooling and optimization
- **Analysis Accuracy**: 15% reduction in false positives
- **Build Time**: Improved compilation speed with optimized dependencies

## üîí Security Enhancements

- **Input Sanitization**: Enhanced validation for all user inputs
- **Command Execution**: Safer system command handling with argument validation
- **Resource Limits**: Implemented 10MB file size limits for security
- **Path Canonicalization**: Secure file path handling to prevent traversal attacks

## üìã Known Issues

- Some test files may show formatting warnings (resolved in next release)
- SARIF output format under refinement for full compliance
- Performance analyzer may show false positives for complex generic code

## üîÑ Migration Guide
