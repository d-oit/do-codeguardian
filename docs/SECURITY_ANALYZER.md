# Security Analyzer
# Updated with optimized patterns and performance improvements

The security analyzer component has been refactored to improve performance and maintainability:

1. Core security analysis is now in `src/analyzers/security_analyzer.rs`
2. Language-specific checks have been moved to `src/analyzers/security_checks.rs`
3. Performance patterns are stored in `src/analyzers/optimized_patterns.rs`

To update the analyzer:

1. Replace existing security_analyzer.rs with the optimized version
2. Add the new security_checks.rs file
3. Update mod.rs to include both modules

The refactoring improves:
- Performance through pattern caching
- Maintainability by separating concerns
- Extensibility for new security checks
