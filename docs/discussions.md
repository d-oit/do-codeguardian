# GitHub Discussions Guide

This guide explains how to effectively use GitHub Discussions in the CodeGuardian repository for community engagement, support, and collaboration.

## Overview

GitHub Discussions provide a forum-style space for conversations that don't fit into Issues or Pull Requests. They're perfect for:
- General discussions about CodeGuardian
- Feature requests and brainstorming
- Q&A and help requests
