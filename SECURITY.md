# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

CodeGuardian is a security-focused code analysis tool designed to identify vulnerabilities, security issues, and potential threats in software projects. As a security tool, we take the security of our own codebase extremely seriously and welcome responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

## üì¢ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in CodeGuardian, please help us by reporting it responsibly. We appreciate your efforts to keep our users safe and will work with you to resolve the issue promptly.

### üö® How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, use one of these secure reporting methods:

#### GitHub Security Advisories
- Visit: https://github.com/d-oit/do-codeguardian/security/advisories/new
- Create a new security advisory
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- GitHub will handle confidential communication
