# CodeGuardian Continuous Improvement System

This directory contains automated tools and scripts for continuous improvement of CodeGuardian's output systems, including performance monitoring, user feedback collection, and optimization cycles.

## Overview

The continuous improvement system consists of four main components:

1. **Automated Monitoring** - Real-time system health monitoring and alerting
2. **Performance Tracking** - Benchmarking and performance regression detection
3. **User Feedback Collection** - Gathering and analyzing user feedback
4. **Optimization Cycles** - Regular performance optimization and feature enhancement

## Components

### 1. Continuous Improvement Manager (`continuous-improvement-manager.sh`)
Orchestrates the complete improvement cycle:
- Runs performance benchmarks
- Collects system metrics
- Analyzes performance trends
- Generates optimization recommendations
- Creates backups

**Usage:**
```bash
./continuous-improvement-manager.sh
```

### 2. Feedback Collector (`feedback-collector.sh`)
Collects and analyzes user feedback:
- Gathers GitHub issues and PR data
- Analyzes usage patterns from logs
- Generates user satisfaction surveys
- Creates feedback trend reports
- Develops improvement roadmaps

**Usage:**
```bash
./feedback-collector.sh
```

### 3. Monitoring Dashboard (`monitoring-dashboard.sh`)
Real-time monitoring and alerting:
- Collects system metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Monitors process health
- Generates alerts for threshold violations
- Creates HTML dashboard
- Displays terminal-based dashboard

**Usage:**
```bash
./monitoring-dashboard.sh
```

## Directory Structure

```

├── README.md                           # This file
├── continuous-improvement-manager.sh   # Main orchestration script
├── feedback-collector.sh              # Feedback collection script
├── monitoring-dashboard.sh            # Monitoring dashboard script
└── templates/                         # Template files (future use)
```

## Generated Outputs

The scripts create organized outputs in the following directories:

### Metrics (`metrics/`)
- `system_metrics_*.json` - System performance metrics
- `benchmark_results_*.json` - Performance benchmark results

### Reports (`reports/`)
- `performance_trends_*.md` - Performance trend analysis
- `optimization_recommendations_*.md` - Optimization suggestions
- `feedback_trends_*.md` - User feedback analysis
- `improvement_roadmap_*.md` - Feature roadmap
- `improvement_report_*.md` - Comprehensive reports

### Feedback (`feedback/`)
- `surveys/survey_*.md` - User satisfaction surveys
- `analytics/usage_patterns_*.md` - Usage pattern analysis
- `github_feedback_*.json` - GitHub issues/PR data

### Monitoring (`monitoring/`)
- `system_metrics_*.json` - Real-time system metrics
- `alerts/` - Alert notifications
- `dashboard/dashboard_*.html` - HTML monitoring dashboard

### Backups (`backups/`)
- `backup_*.tar.gz` - System configuration backups

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `CPU_THRESHOLD` - CPU usage alert threshold (default: 80%)
- `MEMORY_THRESHOLD` - Memory usage alert threshold (default: 85%)
- `DISK_THRESHOLD` - Disk usage alert threshold (default: 90%)
- `ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD` - Error rate alert threshold (default: 5%)

### Threshold Tuning
Modify the threshold values in the scripts to adjust alert sensitivity:

```bash
# In monitoring-dashboard.sh
CPU_THRESHOLD=80
MEMORY_THRESHOLD=85
DISK_THRESHOLD=90
ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD=5
```

## Automated Workflows

### GitHub Actions Integration
The system integrates with GitHub Actions via `.github/workflows/continuous-improvement.yml`:

- **Scheduled Runs**: Weekly comprehensive improvement cycle
- **Manual Triggers**: On-demand improvement analysis
- **Multiple Modes**: Full cycle, monitoring-only, feedback-only, etc.
- **Automated Reporting**: Creates GitHub issues with findings
- **Artifact Management**: Uploads detailed reports and metrics

### Workflow Triggers
- **Scheduled**: Every Monday at 9 AM UTC (comprehensive cycle)
- **Manual**: Via GitHub Actions dispatch with custom parameters
- **Failure Handling**: Creates regression alerts on failures

## Usage Examples

### Run Complete Improvement Cycle
```bash
cd /path/to/codeguardian
./scripts/continuous-improvement/continuous-improvement-manager.sh
```

### Monitor System Health
```bash
./scripts/continuous-improvement/monitoring-dashboard.sh
```

### Collect User Feedback
```bash
./scripts/continuous-improvement/feedback-collector.sh
```

### View Monitoring Dashboard
```bash
./scripts/continuous-improvement/monitoring-dashboard.sh
# Then open monitoring/dashboard/dashboard_*.html in browser
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Performance Framework
Integrates with `src/performance/` modules:
- Uses `PerformanceMetrics` for tracking
- Leverages `PerformanceAnalyzer` for insights
- Works with `PerformanceProfiler` for timing

### Metrics Framework
Works with `src/output/metrics/` system:
- Uses `OutputMetricsCollector` for data collection
- Integrates with `AutomatedReporter` for notifications
- Leverages `TrendAnalyzer` for pattern detection

### Continuous Improvement System
Enhances `src/output/continuous_improvement.rs`:
- Provides data for A/B testing
- Supplies feedback for improvement recommendations
- Enables automated optimization cycles

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Scripts Fail to Execute
```bash
# Ensure scripts are executable
chmod +x scripts/continuous-improvement/*.sh

# Check dependencies
sudo apt-get install jq bc curl
```

#### Missing Metrics Data
```bash
# Check if monitoring directories exist
ls -la metrics/ monitoring/

# Verify system monitoring tools
which top free df ps
```

#### Benchmark Failures
```bash
# Check Rust toolchain
rustc --version
cargo --version

# Verify benchmark configuration
cargo bench --list
```

#### Permission Issues
```bash
# Ensure write permissions for output directories
chmod -R 755 metrics/ reports/ feedback/ monitoring/ backups/
```

### Debug Mode
Run scripts with verbose output:
```bash
bash -x ./scripts/continuous-improvement/monitoring-dashboard.sh
```

## Future Enhancements
