# Workflow Testing Guide

This file was created to test the GitHub Actions workflows after fixing all syntax errors.

## Test Results Expected

### 1. CodeGuardian CI Workflow
- Should trigger on push to main branch
- Will attempt to build and run CodeGuardian
- Expected to fail at installation step (since we're using a placeholder URL)
- But YAML parsing should succeed

### 2. Issue Triage Workflow  
- Triggers on issues (opened, edited, reopened)
- Should parse successfully but won't run on push

### 3. Turbo Workflows
- Various turbo analysis workflows
- Should parse successfully
- Some may trigger on push to main

## Testing Steps

1. ✅ All workflows pass YAML validation
2. 🔄 Commit changes to trigger workflows
3. 📊 Check GitHub Actions tab for execution
4. 🐛 Debug any runtime issues (not syntax issues)

## Notes

- Syntax errors are now resolved
- Runtime errors may occur due to missing dependencies
- This is expected and normal for initial testing
