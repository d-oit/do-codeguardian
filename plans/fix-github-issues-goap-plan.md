# GOAP Plan: Fix GitHub Issues

## Goal Summary
**Goal**: Resolve the issues identified in the GitHub push monitoring report, including license compliance failures causing workflow failures, performance regressions (issues #114 and #113), documentation inaccuracies (issues #112 and #110), and deployment blockers due to failed workflows. The objective is to achieve successful deployments, optimized performance, accurate documentation, and compliant dependencies.

**Initial State**: 
- Workflows are failing due to license compliance issues.
- Performance has regressed as reported in issues #114 and #113.
- Documentation contains inaccuracies as per issues #112 and #110.
- Deployments are blocked by the failed workflows.
- Project dependencies and code are accessible for analysis.

## Actions Defined
Each action includes preconditions (what must be true to execute), effects (changes to the world state), and cost (estimated time/resources in arbitrary units, e.g., hours or effort level).

1. **Audit Dependencies for License Compliance**
   - **Preconditions**: Access to project dependency files (e.g., Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock) and license checking tools.
   - **Effects**: Identifies non-compliant or missing licenses in dependencies; generates a report of required updates.
   - **Cost**: 2

2. **Update Licenses**
   - **Preconditions**: Audit report from dependency auditing is available.
   - **Effects**: Updates dependencies to use compliant licenses or replaces non-compliant ones; ensures all dependencies meet license standards.
   - **Cost**: 3

3. **Fix Workflow Configurations**
   - **Preconditions**: License compliance issues have been identified and addressed.
   - **Effects**: Updates CI/CD workflow files to pass license checks; workflows no longer fail due to license issues.
   - **Cost**: 2

4. **Analyze Performance Regressions**
   - **Preconditions**: Access to performance benchmarks, issue details (#114, #113), and profiling tools.
   - **Effects**: Identifies root causes of performance regressions (e.g., inefficient code, memory leaks).
   - **Cost**: 4

5. **Optimize Performance**
   - **Preconditions**: Root causes from performance analysis are known.
   - **Effects**: Implements optimizations (e.g., code refactoring, algorithm improvements); performance regressions are resolved.
   - **Cost**: 5

6. **Review Documentation**
   - **Preconditions**: Access to documentation files and issue details (#112, #110).
   - **Effects**: Identifies specific inaccuracies in documentation (e.g., outdated examples, incorrect API descriptions).
   - **Cost**: 3

7. **Update Documentation**
   - **Preconditions**: Inaccuracies from documentation review are identified.
   - **Effects**: Corrects documentation to reflect current code and features; issues #112 and #110 are resolved.
   - **Cost**: 2

8. **Fix Compilation Errors**
   - **Preconditions**: Access to source code and Rust compiler (cargo).
   - **Effects**: Resolves compilation errors (e.g., missing imports, incorrect return types in async functions); code builds successfully.
   - **Cost**: 4

9. **Test Deployments**
   - **Preconditions**: Workflows are fixed, performance is optimized, documentation is updated, and compilation errors are resolved.
   - **Effects**: Runs deployment tests to ensure workflows pass and deployments succeed without blockers.
   - **Cost**: 3

## Generated Plan
The plan uses a GOAP-inspired search to sequence actions, prioritizing parallel execution where possible to minimize total cost. Total estimated cost: 28 units.

1. **Audit Dependencies for License Compliance** (Cost: 2)  
   Rationale: Start with auditing to identify license issues, as they are blocking workflows. This provides the foundation for subsequent fixes.

2. **Update Licenses** (Cost: 3)  
   Rationale: Directly addresses the audit findings to resolve compliance failures.

3. **Fix Workflow Configurations** (Cost: 2)  
   Rationale: Applies the license updates to workflows, unblocking deployments. Dependency: License updates completed.

4. **Analyze Performance Regressions** (Cost: 4)  
   Rationale: Concurrent with license fixes, analyze performance issues to identify causes. Can run in parallel with steps 1-3 if resources allow.

5. **Review Documentation** (Cost: 3)  
   Rationale: Concurrent with performance analysis, review docs for inaccuracies. Parallel execution to optimize time.

6. **Optimize Performance** (Cost: 5)  
   Rationale: Implements fixes based on analysis. Dependency: Performance analysis completed.

7. **Update Documentation** (Cost: 2)  
   Rationale: Corrects docs based on review. Dependency: Documentation review completed.

8. **Fix Compilation Errors** (Cost: 4)  
   Rationale: Resolves code compilation issues that may contribute to workflow failures. Can run in parallel with performance and docs updates.

9. **Test Deployments** (Cost: 3)  
   Rationale: Validates that all fixes work together, ensuring no regressions and successful deployments. Dependencies: Workflows fixed, performance optimized, docs updated, compilation errors resolved.

## Analysis
**Pros**:
- Systematic approach ensures all issues are addressed without overlap.
- Parallel execution of analysis steps (performance and docs) reduces total time.
- Modular actions allow for easy tracking and rollback if needed.
- Focuses on root causes, preventing future regressions.

**Cons**:
- High total cost due to sequential dependencies in some areas (e.g., optimization requires analysis).
- Assumes access to all tools and resources; delays if external dependencies (e.g., third-party licenses) are involved.
- Potential for new issues to arise during optimization or updates.

**Contingencies**:
- If auditing reveals complex license conflicts, escalate to legal experts or consider open-source alternatives.
- If performance analysis identifies hardware-specific issues, run benchmarks on target environments.
- If documentation updates conflict with code changes, re-review and sync with development team.
- If compilation errors are too numerous or complex, prioritize critical files and use automated tools like rustfmt or clippy for assistance.
- If deployment tests fail, revert to previous states and investigate unaddressed dependencies.
- Overall fallback: Break into sub-plans if the scope becomes too large, prioritizing critical blockers (workflows) first.
