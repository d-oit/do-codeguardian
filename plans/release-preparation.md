- Ensure all changes are tested and pass CI/CD pipelines.
- Run comprehensive test suite: `cargo test --all-features`.

### 2. Version Bump

- Update any version references in documentation or config files.

### 3. Changelog Update
- Add new section in `CHANGELOG.md` for v0.2.1-alpha.
- Document all fixes, features, and changes since v0.2.0.
- Categorize changes: Added, Fixed, Changed, Removed.

### 4. Release Notes
- Create or update `docs/releases/v0.2.1-alpha.md` with detailed release notes.
- Include installation instructions, breaking changes, and upgrade guide.
- Highlight key fixes and improvements.

### 5. Build and Validation
- Build release version: `cargo build --release`.
- Run linting: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`.
- Run benchmarks: `cargo bench` to ensure no regressions.
- Validate on multiple platforms if possible.

### 6. Tagging and Publishing
- Create git tag: `git tag v0.2.1-alpha`.
- Push tag to repository.
- Publish to crates.io if applicable: `cargo publish`.

## Current Progress
- **Version Status**: Current version in Cargo.toml is 0.2.1-alpha, following semantic versioning for pre-release.
- **Changelog Status**: CHANGELOG.md includes comprehensive entries for v0.2.1-alpha, documented as released on 2025-09-18 (today). However, verification needed to confirm if the release has actually occurred or if the changelog entry is premature.
- **Release Workflows**: Automated release workflows are configured, including turbo-release.yml for post-release validation and release-notes.yml for generating automated release notes.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Comprehensive CI/CD pipelines are in place.
- **Validation Reports**: Validation reports exist for previous versions, but need updating for v0.2.1-alpha.
- **Release Notes**: No specific release notes file for v0.2.1-alpha yet in docs/releases/.

## Remaining Todos
- Verify if v0.2.1-alpha has actually been released or if the CHANGELOG.md entry is premature.
- Create detailed release notes file in `docs/releases/v0.2.1-alpha.md`.
- Update validation reports for v0.2.1-alpha.
- Ensure all CI checks pass.
- Tag and publish the release if not already done.

## Recommendations
- Consider moving to stable v0.2.1 if alpha testing is complete and no issues are found.
- Enhance release automation with pre-release validation steps.
- Add a release candidate process for better quality assurance before final releases.
- Implement automated version bumping to streamline the release process.
- Add release metrics tracking to monitor release success and gather feedback.
