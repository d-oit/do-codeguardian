## Project Overview
CodeGuardian is a Rust-based security analysis platform with integrated machine learning capabilities for automated code analysis, vulnerability detection, and performance optimization. It combines traditional static analysis with ML-powered false positive reduction using RUV-FANN neural networks.

## Setup Commands
- **Install Rust toolchain**: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
- **Install dependencies**: `cargo build`
- **Run development server**: `cargo run -- --help`
- **Run tests**: `cargo test`
- **Format code**: `cargo fmt`
- **Lint code**: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`

## Code Style
- **Rust 2021 Edition** with strict compiler settings
- **Naming**: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for types/structs, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- **Error Handling**: Use `anyhow::Result<T>` for application errors, `thiserror::Error` for library error types
- **Security-First**: Always validate inputs, use safe defaults, prevent resource exhaustion
- **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's ownership system, avoid unsafe code unless absolutely necessary
- **Performance**: Use async/await patterns, parallel processing where appropriate, memory pooling
- **Code Size**: Keep functions under 50-100 lines, files under 300-700 lines

## Testing Instructions
- **Unit Tests**: Run `cargo test` for all tests, `cargo test <test_name>` for specific tests
- **Integration Tests**: Use `cargo test --test <integration_test>` for end-to-end testing
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Run `cargo bench` or use `./scripts/performance_analysis.sh`
- **Security Testing**: Focus on input validation, path traversal, and resource limits
- **ML Testing**: Validate model accuracy, false positive rates, and training data integrity
- **CI Testing**: All tests must pass before merging, including security and performance checks

## Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: Always validate file paths, sizes, and content before processing
- **Resource Limits**: Implement file size limits (10MB default), memory bounds, and timeout handling
- **Path Security**: Use canonical paths, prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Data Handling**: Secure ML training data, avoid exposing sensitive information
